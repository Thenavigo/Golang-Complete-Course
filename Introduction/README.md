	 Introduction - What Is Golang?
```

- ðŸ¤¤ **Golang** So today we are going to start with a new programming language that is Golang, which is made by Google, and this is a very exciting new, very famous programming language. It has not given that much traction in the past. But just recently, like, you know, three or four years, it has gained some traction from developers, attraction because Google has been using it. Google has been, you know, extensively showing it to the word, use it. And there have been many other companies which have been using Google and started using Google. It is majorly built on Google. And so what I can tell you is, according to the definition, Google is a minimalistic language. But yes, it is robust. It has full of features. If you have learned C++ in the past, Golang would be easy because it is compiler based language, strict procedural. It has its own compiler and Linux. You only need to install it in your machine and it would start running because Mac OS and Linux both have GCT in their operating systems installed. Even it has to go along with it. There is a short introduction of what you saw in this course.
